        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Outside of work, my life is pretty simple. I'm almost always listening to 
          music—it keeps my energy high and my head in a good space. That energy carries 
          into the gym, a habit I've maintained since I was 15.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Training is my real mental reset. I've been practicing Muay Thai and BJJ since 
          I was 17, and I'm a huge UFC fan. Those sports teach you the real lessons: 
          constant failure, facing someone better, and getting tapped out or caught with 
          a clean shot. But that’s the point—it forces a mindset where you can’t quit 
          when things get tough. You learn, adjust, and survive.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          That lesson in resilience—getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and 
          never giving up—flows into everything else. It’s shaped how I approach work, 
          relationships, and any hard problem in front of me. It keeps me grounded and 
          ready to push through.
