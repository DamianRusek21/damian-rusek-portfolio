          Outside of work, my life is pretty simple. I'm almost always listening to music—it keeps my energy high and my head in a good space. That energy carries into the gym, a habit I've maintained since I was 15.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black-800 leading-relaxed">
          Training is my real mental reset. I've been practicing Muay Thai and BJJ since I was 17, and I'm a huge UFC fan. Those sports teach you the real lessons: constant failure, facing someone better, and getting tapped out or caught with a clean shot. But that’s the point—it forces a mindset where you can’t quit when things get tough. You learn, adjust, and survive.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black-800 leading-relaxed">
          That lesson in resilience—getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and never giving up—flows into everything else. It’s shaped how I approach work, relationships, and any hard problem in front of me. It keeps me grounded and ready to push through.
